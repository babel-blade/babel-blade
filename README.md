# Babel-Blade ⛸️

`babel-blade` is the collective name for the babel plugin/macro that helps to generate graphql query strings inline and solves [the double declaration problem](https://babel-blade.netlify.com/docs/declarationdeclaration.html).

Check **[our new Docs site](https://babel-blade.netlify.com/)** or view [my 7 minute talk at React Boston](https://youtu.be/30wOsJOluA4?t=497) for an explainer!

## Guide to this repository

This is a monorepo managed by [`lerna`](https://lernajs.io). Let's go through the folder structure:

- `/docs`: source markdown files for our Docusaurus docs
- `/website`: the rest of the files (React, Site config, etc) for our Docusaurus docs
- `/packages/babel.macro`: a very small/insignificant wrapper of `babel-plugin-blade` for hooking into `babel-plugin-macros`. Published as [blade.macro](https://npm.im/blade.macro).
- `/packages/babel-plugin-blade`: the core of this repo, the secret sauce. Published as [babel-plugin-blade](https://npm.im/babel-plugin-blade). It has a separate README, go in there if interested to learn more about its inner workings. If you are just looking to use `babel-plugin-blade` you can just check out **[our new Docs site](https://babel-blade.netlify.com/)**.

## publishing check list

1. `npm run build` on `packages/babel-plugin-blade`
